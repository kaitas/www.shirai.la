								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well today spend some a lot of time being on the bank and  cancelling our apartments. Most is done now and would say it went pretty well. It cost me 1200yen to send a letter to the united states.</p>
<p>Allright, all the textures is finally finished. Now I am planning on how to prepare for the presentation that is soon to come. Quite a lot have been made since came here. All the characters, props and environment, all the textures and 3d animatic etc etc. The thing is, how can you compress everything to one presentation? Well I got some ideas going on right now. But tomorrow is photosession time as I understand it and it is suit on!</p>
<p>This is a picture of testing the final textures for the cardboxes. A massive update is planned for the production blog soon (<a href="http://khamlicious.tumblr.com" class="autohyperlink">khamlicious.tumblr.com</a>). Hopefully on Friday depending on how much time is left.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Allright, little spare time for the wicked. Been working like crazy nowadays. The list of props that need to texture is quite large. I am checking off my list texture by texture. My overall tempo is about two textures per hours depends on how advance it is. Some needs to re-texturise. The thing is it is all hand painted(or photoshop painted), meaning I do not just pick a color and tweak some adjustment, nor do I take a picture for textures. Every different object(or 3d modell) have a unique texture (well except for copies of the same object of course)</p>
<p>It may be time consuming, but the reward is greater. I get the look that I am after. Want it to look like a child or an amature have painted on a real life object. To &#8220;fake&#8221; a traditional paint look in a digital platform is a bit challenging, but then again it is the artistic style I am after.</p>
<p>I am on a good way and more then half of the props is textured. But there is still some work to be done.<br />

<p>Tomorrow, we have to head down to Hon-atsugi to end our apartment contract. The time flies and we are preparing our trip back home to Sweden. It is with mixed feelings to fly home. I will miss japan and people I have met here, at the same time I need to continue my work in Sweden.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading,<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Been updating my textures, finally found a look I really like. This week updates will be short and I may not update with a picture everyday. The reason is I am mainly doing the textures now and it might look more interesting with some lights and when everything is finshed. Right now half the characters have the &#8220;new&#8221; look. It is a little more painterly. My goal is to have every character finished by today.</p>
<p>Then the rest of the week will be about texturing the props and environment. Hopefully everything will run smoothly.</p>
